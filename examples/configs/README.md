# Configs Folder

This folder contains sanitized configuration files used as sources for diagram examples.

- All sensitive data (such as IP addresses, hostnames, certificates, and passwords) has been replaced or removed.
- The network structure and logic remain authentic to demonstrate real-world complexity and scenarios.

Use these files as references for generating diagrams or for understanding how real configurations map to visual representations.
